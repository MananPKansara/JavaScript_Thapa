// HTML events are the things that happen to the HTML elements.
// When js is used in HTML pages, js can "react" on these events.
// An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

// Here are some examples of HTML events :
// An HTML input field was changes
// An HTML page has finished loading
// An HTML button was clicked

// There are 4 ways of writing events in js
// 1. using inline events alert()
// 2. By calling a function
// 3. using inline events (HTML onClick="" property and element.onclick)
// 4. using event listners (addEventListner) 
// All types are explained in 1st example file 

// Event object is the parent object of the event object
// For example mouseEvent, focusEvent, keyboardEvent etc.
// See example 2

// MouseEvent in js
// The mouse evenet object
// events that occur when the mouse interacts with the HTML
// document belongs to the mouse event object
// see example 3

// KeyboardEvent in js
// events that occures when user resses a key on the keyvbored 
// belongs to the keyboard event object
// see example 4

// InputEvent in js
// onchanged event occurs when the value of an element has been changed
// see example 5

// Timing based events
// The window object allows execution of code at specified time interval
// The two key methods to use with js are :
// setTimeout(function, millisecond)
// Execution of the function, after a specified number of millisecond
// setInterval(function, millisecond)
// Same as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function conntinuously

// setTimeout()
// clearTimeout()
// setInterval()
// clearInterval()
// see example 6 and 7
